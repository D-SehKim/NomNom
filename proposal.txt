          - Pain points you're addressing:
            - For our app, we aim to address three main pain points. The first is keeping track of food expiration dates. 
            Many people forget when they purchased certain items or when those items will expire, which often leads to 
            unnecessary food waste as forgotten items spoil in the fridge. The second pain point is managing what you 
            already have at home. It’s common for people to go grocery shopping and forget what they still have, leading 
            to duplicate purchases or missing key ingredients they intended to buy. This not only results in more food 
            waste but also wasted time when people have to make additional trips to the store. Finally, the third pain 
            point is dealing with leftovers or partial ingredients. People often find themselves with leftover items 
            they don’t know how to use. They may need to buy more ingredients just to make a meal, or spend extra time 
            searching for recipes that fit what they have. This inconvenience can make takeout seem like the easier option, 
            leading to more food waste and expense.
